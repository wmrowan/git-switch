To install simply plop the git-switch file anywhere on your path.
You can then run `git switch` in your git repositories.

Use `switch` inplace of `checkout` when switching between branches
to non-destructively change branches. Any work-in-progress state
is saved as well as any uncontrolled files (such as a build dir)
in the working tree.
